Problem 1: BST Implementation
============================

Implement a binary search tree with the following operations:
- insert(key, value)
- search(key)
- delete(key)
- inorder_traversal()

My Implementation:

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, key, value):
        self.key = key
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class BST:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None
    
    def insert(self, key, value):
        if self.root is None:
            self.root = TreeNode(key, value)
        else:
            self._insert_recursive(self.root, key, value)
    
    def _insert_recursive(self, node, key, value):
        if key < node.key:
            if node.left is None:
                node.left = TreeNode(key, value)
            else:
                self._insert_recursive(node.left, key, value)
        elif key > node.key:
            if node.right is None:
                node.right = TreeNode(key, value)
            else:
                self._insert_recursive(node.right, key, value)

Problem 2: Time Complexity Analysis
===================================

Search Operation: O(log n) average case, O(n) worst case
Insert Operation: O(log n) average case, O(n) worst case
Delete Operation: O(log n) average case, O(n) worst case

The worst case occurs when the tree becomes skewed (essentially a linked list).

Problem 3: Balancing Discussion
===============================

To maintain O(log n) operations, we could use:
- AVL trees (height-balanced)
- Red-black trees (color-balanced)
- Splay trees (self-adjusting)

I think AVL trees would be best because they guarantee the strictest balance.

Notes for Exam:
- Remember BST property: left < root < right
- In-order traversal gives sorted sequence
- Practice tree rotations for balancing
